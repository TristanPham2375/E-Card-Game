# E-Card-Game
A digital card game inspired by the TV series Kaiji: The Ultimate Survivor, featuring two playable card decks and a simple graphical user interface (GUI). This project implements a restricted rock-paper-scissors algorithm to simulate the original gameplay, with customized rules and win conditions.

ðŸŽ® Features
Two Playable Decks: Choose between Emperor and Slave decks.
Custom Game Rules: Game logic and rules designed to replicate the strategic nature of Kaijiâ€™s E-Card game.
Simple GUI: Built with Tkinter, providing an accessible interface for gameplay.
Algorithm Design: Utilizes a unique variation of rock-paper-scissors mechanics for card interactions.

ðŸ’» Technologies Used
Language: Python
Libraries: Tkinter for GUI, custom algorithms and data structures for game logic
Design Principles: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), structured and modular code for easy understanding and extension

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
main.py: The main entry point of the game, initializes the GUI and handles user input.
card.py: Defines card classes and properties for Emperor and Citizen decks.
game_logic.py: Contains core game algorithms, including the restricted rock-paper-scissors mechanism.
gui.py: Sets up the Tkinter interface and manages user interaction elements.
